SUMMARY OF PROJECT

IN THIS PROJECT ALL CAPSULE OBJECTS ARE HELD DYNAMICLY IN 
MEMORY WITH A POINTER. IN ORDER TO LINK EVERY ITEM TO EACH
THERE EXISTS A PREV AND NEXT POINTER TOO. ýN CONSTRUCTION
OF AIRCRAFT CLASS THERE EXISTS A CAPSULE TYPE POINTER TO 
ACCESS THOSE DYNAMIC MEMORIES. LINKED LIST IS A CIRCULAR 
DOUBLY LINKED LIST MEANING THAT LAST ITEM IN THE LIST SHOWS
FIRST (NOT NULL) AND ALL OBJECTS CAN ACCESS THEIR NEXT AND
PREV ITEM IN LIST. 

INTEGRATE FUNCTION

INTEGRATE FUNCTION ACCEPTS NEW ITEM IN LIST. ALSO, IT IS 
ALWAYS ORDERED ACCORDING TO THE LONGITUDES.THEY ARE HELD BETWEEN 0-360 AND IF USER INPUTS A LONGITUDE
SMALLER THAN ZERO IT MAPS THAT VALUE BETWEEN 180 AND 360.
SAME TRICK IS ALSO USED IN AIRCAFT LONGITUDE.

UPDATE HEAD FUNCTION

IT UPDATES THE HEAD POINTER BEFORE SIMULATING THE FLIGHT.
THIS FUNCTION IS USED BECAUSE WHILE INTEGRATING PONTER OF
AIRCRAFT HELDS THE MINIMUM LONGITUDE IN LIST. IT SHOULD BE
ALLIGNED ACCORDING TO THE LONGITUDE VALUE OF AIRCRAFT.

DROP FUNCTION

IT JUST SIMPLY DELETES THE OBJECT PONTED BY HEAD.

DISPLAY FUNCTIONS

THEY ARE USED TO DISPLAY ITEMS, SITUATION OF AIRCRAFT

COMPLEXITY

THE WORST CASE OF PROJECT OCCURS WHEN AN OBJECT WITH
MAXIMUM IS INSERTED IN LIST AND UPDATING THE HEAD POINTER.
THE WORST CASE IS TRAVERSING THE WHOLE LIST WHICH IS ORDER
OF N. THE BEST CASE IS ORDER ALSO N SINCE I DROP ALL THE ITEMS
IN LIST THEREFORE FUNCTION IS ORDER OF N WHICH IS IN LIMITS
DEFINED BEFORE.
